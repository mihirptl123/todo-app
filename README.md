## --->Features

- ✅ **Add Tasks**  
  Users can type and add new tasks to their to-do list.

- ❌ **Delete Tasks**  
  Each task comes with a delete (❌) button to remove it from the list.

- 💾 **Persistent Storage**  
  All tasks are saved in `localStorage` so your list stays even after refreshing.

- 🌙 **Dark Mode Toggle**  
  Switch between light and dark themes using the toggle button — theme preference is remembered using localStorage.
